# Contributing to Javaluator

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Javaluator!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, please ask away on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javaluator) using the tag `javaluator`.

The community may assist you. Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in Javaluator? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/fathzer/javaluator/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments or use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

* **Note:** Because the developers need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient.

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue

* [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!

## Contributing Fixes

If you are interested in writing code to fix issues, fork the repository, write your code in a branch of this forked repository.

Please remember to do the following
 * [ ] Create a JUnit test that tests your new code.
 * [ ] Try to match the style of existing code (your style is maybe better, but javaluator developers will maintain your piece of code, not you ...).
 * [ ] Ensure that all the JUnit tests for the whole project still succeed.

When your contribution is ready, create a merge request.
